        <h1>Welcome to Bazingacoin!</h1>
        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            Bazingacoin was created 
            as a cryptocurrency to make fun of 
            cryptocurrencies. There was always the
            possibility that we could collapse the stock
            market with 1 trillion in circulation,
            but we decided not to think about that.
        </p>
        <h2>The Team</h2>
