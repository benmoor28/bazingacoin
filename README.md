# bazingacoin
The cryptocurrency that makes fun of cryptocurrencies

bazingacoin is a currency that was made as a joke, (some may say it is a classic pratical joke).

This is code for the token's smart contract.

Because I am way too lazy and can't be asked bazingacoin's blockchain is based off that of ethereum (ERC-20), it is techinacally a token, bazingatoken, na.

Fellow contributers and founding fathers of bazingacoin are:

- Galaxisstark 

- Gandolphin

- Man like Joel

Coded in Solidity.

Maybe one day it will launch!
